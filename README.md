Header (Navbar)
Hero Section (Main Section)
Latest Blog Section
More Blogs Section
Footer
Header (Navbar)
The header component has the logo positioned on the left and navigation links on the right. This should be constructed using the <nav> and <ul> HTML elements for correct semantics. Make sure that the header sticks to the top of the screen even on scrolling.

Hero Section (Main Section)
This section has text on the left and an image on the right. It also has a background image which can be exported directly from the Figma design. Your task is to ensure the components are properly laid out. For the background, you can either export the background in the Figma, or give a linear gradient of your own.

Latest Blogs Section
This section includes a single blog element that stretches full width. It has an image on the left and blog content on the right. Make sure you follow the Figma design closely. Make sure you use Flexbox property properly for this. And you use the correct tags for the text.

More Blogs Section
The More Blogs section displays three additional blogs arranged with flexbox. The section should also incorporate the flex-wrap property to ensure a responsive design.

Footer
The Footer is similar to the Hero section, but it contains different text and assets. Again, follow the Figma design closely. And for the button feel free to use a linear background of your choice, or use the one from the figma
